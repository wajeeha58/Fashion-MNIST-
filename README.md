# Fashion MNIST Classification with CNN Model

## Objective:
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into one of 10 fashion categories.

## Approach:
- Conducted data preprocessing, including normalization and reshaping of images.
- Built and trained a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- Enhanced model performance using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization.
- Evaluated and optimized the model to ensure robust classification performance.

## Results:
Achieved a classification accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating effective model training and evaluation.
